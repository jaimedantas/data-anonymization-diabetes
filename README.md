# Data anonymization   for Machine Learning
Impacts of data anonymization  on model prediction for diabetes. A feed-forward neural network is trained on the anonymized  data and the accuracy is compared. 
### Feed-forward neural network

### Diferential Privacy
Two techniques are applied for  anonymization: Laplace noise and generalization herarchies.

### Dataset
The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset.) contains 16 features and 520 records which were collected using direct questionnaires
from the patients of Sylhet Diabetes Hospital in Sylhet, Bangladeshusi.
